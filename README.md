# BigNeuron reconstruction sample set

This directory contains a set of reconstructions provided by the 
[BigNeuron](alleninstitute.org/bigneuron/) collaborators. There are two sorts
of reconstruction:

1. manual, gold standard reconstructions originally available 
   [here](https://github.com/BigNeuron/docs/wiki/Neuron-Annotation-Data)
2. Automated reconstructions from up to 43 tools (including variants/updates
   of the same tool)

These were collated by Xiaoxiao Liu at the time of the [BigNeuron Analysis 
Hackathon at Imperial College](https://github.com/BigNeuron/docs/wiki/BigNeuron-Imperial-Discussion-Notes)
and distributed to participants on 2016-01-20.
